It is, in some ways, similar to a `<script src="…">`{html} or `<link href="…">`{html} for JavaScript and CSS respectively.

## Syntax

```js
register(url);
```

### Parameters

`url`{arg}
: A string or `URL`{js} object to a Yozo component file.

### Return value

A `Promise`{js} that resolves whenever the component is defined, akin to `customElements.whenDefined(…)`{js}. When the component file contains syntactical errors, the return value is a rejected promise; otherwise, the registration will succeed. Calling `register`{js} multiple times with the same URL does not cause additional registrations, and all calls return the same promise that resolves when the component is ready to be used.

**Note:** It is possible to dynamically register components found on the page or in other components through [`register.auto()`](/docs/register/auto/).

## Examples

### Readability

For better readability, it is advised not to destructure the `register()`{js} function, instead using the full `window.yozo.`{js} prefix, like so:

```js
window.yozo.register('/path/to/component.yz');
```

Additionally, while component files "import" (i.e. implicitly destructure) Yozo's functionality by default, this is not the case for the `register()`{js} function specifically. In practice, this means the prefix (or explicit destructuring) is necessary in all contexts.

### Error handling

There are a few ways errors might occur during component registration. They are caused by syntactical errors in the component definition, including malformed HTML, invalid JavaScript, or a missing [`<title>`](/docs/components/title/) element. If an error is thrown, no custom element is defined, and the promise returned by `register()`{js} is rejected. For example, let's say we have a component file as follows:

```yz
<title>uh-oh</title>
<script>
this is not JavaScript, it's a syntax error!
</script>
```

The above creates an invalid block of JavaScript, which simply cannot be parsed. Thus, if we attempt to register the above, the registration will fail, resulting in a rejected promise that we can catch:

```js
try {
	await window.yozo.register('/components/uh-oh.yz');
} catch (error) {
	console.log(error.message); // "unexpected token"
}
```

We might also verify using `customElements.get(…)`{js} (which is a native web components API) that the element was not defined. For defined elements, it returns the constructor for the registered custom element, and it returns `undefined`{js} otherwise:

```js
console.log(customElements.get('uh-oh')); // undefined
```
